# Dogs-of-the-Dow
The Dogs of the Dow is a stock investment strategy that selects the 10 highest-yielding stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) at the end of each year. The strategy is based on the idea that these stocks are more likely to outperform the market in the coming year because they are undervalued.
In this project, I implemented the Dogs of the Dow and Small dogs of the Dow (5 highest-yielding stocks in DJIA) in Python, to check the performance and names involved.
